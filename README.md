# Rowdy Run: Help little Rowdy journey through the ages, dodge obstacles, and conquer trivia challenges to reach the opening ceremony before it starts at Rowdyhacks IX!

### Inspiration
We wanted to create a fun and educational game that is combined with the spirit of the hackathon! We wanted to ultimately create a product that we could see in action, since there are few projects where you truly get to engage with the project.

### What it does
Rowdy Run is an exciting retro-style dinosaur game where players take little Rowdy on a journey through epochs in which dinosaurs roamed, encountering various obstacles and challenges. The gameplay involves advancing through levels with progressive difficulty using simple keyboard controls and answering trivia questions to defeat bosses.

### How we built it
Rowdy Run was built using Unity, a powerful game development engine. C# played a crucial role in implementing various aspects of the game, from defining game logic to handling user input and interactions. We utilized Unity's features to design captivating animations, implement gameplay mechanics, and create an engaging user interface. The game assets, including backgrounds and sprites, were carefully crafted on Piskel and handpicked to enhance the overall atmosphere and elevate the gaming experience.

### Challenges we ran into
Mastering Unity's animation system posed a significant learning curve, especially since one out of the two people in our group had zero experience with Unity and C# 3 days before RowdyHacks! Additionally, we had to learn how to create animations, and there was a lot of trouble with creating scrolling textures and implementing a parallax effect in the background.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Learned how to make good animations on Unity!!
- We spent tireless hours poring over fine details and finally created a beautiful and aesthetic game that we are proud of! We will be showing our friends and family the game for many days to come :)

### What we learned
- One of the team members went from knowing zero C# and Unity or any sort of game development experience to knowing how to create complex animations, make entire scenes, and use C# to handle user input and generate assets for the game!
- We learned how to create animation controllers and how to do sprite splicing.

### What's next for Rowdy Run
- We want to add more levels and create more complex trivia questions at each boss level. We also want to add more common bosses as you progress through the levels aside from the final boss at the end of each era.
- We want to add music and sound effects
